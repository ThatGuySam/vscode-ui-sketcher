# Setup URL Preview

## How it works

- If the opened text file is not empty, the preview frame will display on open
- If the opened text file is empty, the preview frame will display on save
- The content should update when the file is saved

## Quirks

- It is recommended to lock the preview frame inside the editor (select the preview, then press `shift+L`) so that you can quickly erase the rest of the canvas on each iteration
- It's always recommended to commit the setup locally in the project's `.vscode/settings.json` file to avoid switching between projects

## Standard

- The preview url should accept a `filePath` query parameter
- The preview page, should load the Component from the `filePath` query parameter dynamically and render it
- The preview page should have hot reloading / live reload enabled
- The preview url should be added to `ui-sketcher.previewUrl` in settings.json without any query parameters (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/preview`)
